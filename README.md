## Pinned Projects: 

### [Product cards matching. Ozon Tech E-CUP (2/110) [Classic ML & NLP]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/ozon-ecup-matching) 

A model was developed that determined by names, attributes and pictures whether two products were the same. This solution will help Ozon customers to improve the user experience, and companies to optimize resources and save on the purchase of server equipment.

*Worked with*: sklearn, transformers, torch, bert, jellyfish, textdistance, rapidfuzz, catboost

### [Classification of documents, attributes extraction. Gagarin Hack (2/60) [CV]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/gagarin-hack-document-reader)

The service, which allows, in API mode, classifies photo scans of automobile documents by their types (driver's license, vehicle registration certificate, vehicle registration certificate, passport of the Russian Federation), as well as the number of the sheet/side of the document, and extracts basic information/attributes from each document.

*Worked with*: opencv, yolo, easyocr

### [Predicting tractor components state based on telemetry data. EESTech (2/30) [Classic ML]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/eestech-hack-tractor-forecasting)

The tractor telemetry data analysis system, which evaluates the correct operation of the tractor and its systems, and predicts their failure, analyzes the systems.

*Worked with*: catboost, sklearn, streamlit

### [E-Commerce Feedback Classification. Deep Learning School & ecom.tech (3/96) [NLP]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/ecom-tech-workshop)

Service for multi-label classification of customer reviews in the field of e-commerce for the Samokat company.

*Worked with*: transformers, peft, skmultilearn, streamlit

### [Predicting the segment of advertising creative. Digital Breakthrough (UFD) (3/12) [Video & Speech]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/mediawise-creative-filter)

A tool that analyzes brand creatives and, based on the content of audio/video files, determines segmentation â€“ in which category to determine media pressure.

*Worked with*: whisper, bert, x-clip, llava, catboost, fastapi

### [Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification. RSNA, Kaggle (Bronze medal) [Medical CV]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/rsna-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification)

The goal of this competition is to create models that can be used to aid in the detection and classification of degenerative spine conditions using lumbar spine MR images. Competitors will develop models that simulate a radiologist's performance in diagnosing spine conditions.

*Worked with*: torch, torchio, open3d, timm_3d, spacecutter, yolo

### [Generating Boolean search queries for patents. USPTO, Kaggle (Bronze medal) [Global Search Optimization]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/ustpo-patent-query-generator)

The goal of this competition is to generate Boolean search queries that effectively characterize collections of patent documents. You are challenged to create a query generation model that, given an input set of related patents, outputs a Boolean query that returns the same set of patent documents.

*Worked with*: whoosh, polars, annealing and genetic algorithms

### [Forecasting banking client churn. IT Purple Hack (4/50) [Classic ML]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/it-purple-hack-sber-case)

A model that helps to predict the moment of a salary client's transfer to another bank by analyzing data on transactions, products used, mobile applications, terminals, etc.

*Worked with*: catboost, sklearn, imblearn, optuna

### [Media Searcher. LCT (Participant) [Video & Speech & CV & NLP]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/media-searcher) 

A service has been developed that allows indexing and searching videos based on media content. The service is able to process user requests, extract keywords from them and use them to search for relevant video files. The ability to quickly and efficiently find content of interest improves the user experience, helps to find new user interests and improve recommendations.

*Worked with*: torch, whisper, clip4clip, easyocr, transformers, faiss, face_recognition

### [Recognizing place on MIPT campus for a mobile robot. MIPT Hack (1/8) [Metric Learning]](https://github.com/l1ghtsource/mipt-hackathon) 

A service has been developed that allows indexing and searching videos based on media content. The service is able to process user requests, extract keywords from them and use them to search for relevant video files. The ability to quickly and efficiently find content of interest improves the user experience, helps to find new user interests and improve recommendations.

*Worked with*: torch, opr, transformers, faiss
